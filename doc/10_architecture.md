# Framework architecture {#architecture}

@brief Architecture of the ColorShapeLinks development framework

[TOC]

## Overview

The ColorShapeLinks development framework offers two application frontends:
the @ref console-guide "ConsoleApp" and the @ref unity-guide "UnityApp".
However, the framework is internally composed of four .NET projects, namely
@ref ColorShapeLinks.Common "Common", @ref ColorShapeLinks.TextBased.App "App",
@ref ColorShapeLinks.TextBased.Lib "Lib" and
@ref ColorShapeLinks.UnityApp "UnityApp", as shown in Figure 1.

## The Common project

The @ref ColorShapeLinks.Common "Common" project is a .NET Standard 2.0 class
library which constitutes the core of the framework. It defines fundamental
models of the ColorShapeLinks game (i.e., of the unbounded Simplexity
game), such as the @ref ColorShapeLinks.Common.Board "board", its
@ref ColorShapeLinks.Common.Piece "pieces" or performed
@ref ColorShapeLinks.Common.Move "moves", and is a dependency of the remaining
projects. It is further subdivided in the @ref ColorShapeLinks.Common.AI "AI"
and @ref ColorShapeLinks.Common.Session "Session" namespaces. The former
defines AI-related abstractions, such as the
@ref ColorShapeLinks.Common.AI.AbstractThinker "AbstractThinker" class, which
other AI thinkers must extend, as well as a manager for finding and
instantiating concrete AI thinkers. The latter specifies a number of match and
session-related interfaces, as well as concrete
@ref ColorShapeLinks.Common.Session.Match "match" and
@ref ColorShapeLinks.Common.Session.Session "session" models.

The @ref ColorShapeLinks.Common "Common" project is hosted
[in its own branch][Common] branch of the Git repository, and is
included as a [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
in both the [ConsoleApp] and [UnityApp] folders of the `master` branch,
which is why the framework needs to be cloned with the `--recurse-submodules`
Git clone option.

The folder structure of the @ref ColorShapeLinks.Common "Common" project is
organized as follows:

* [**Common**][Common] - Board, pieces, moves, etc.
  * [AI] - AI-related abstractions and management of AI thinkers.
    * [Examples] - Example AI thinkers.
  * [Session] - Match and session classes and related interfaces.

Namespaces follow the folder organization. For example, code in the
[Session] folder is under the ColorShapeLinks.Common.Session namespace.

## The ConsoleApp projects

The @ref console-guide "ConsoleApp" is composed of two projects,
@ref ColorShapeLinks.TextBased.App "App" and
@ref ColorShapeLinks.TextBased.Lib "Lib", both of which depend on the
@ref ColorShapeLinks.Common "Common" class library, as shown in Figure 1. The
@ref ColorShapeLinks.TextBased.App "App" project is a .NET Core console
application with an external dependency on the [CommandLineParser] library
and an internal
dependency on the @ref ColorShapeLinks.TextBased.Lib "Lib" project â€“ itself
a .NET Standard 2.0 class library. The @ref ColorShapeLinks.TextBased.App "App"
project provides the actual console frontend, namely the text user interface
(TUI) with which the user interacts in order to run ColorShapeLinks matches and
sessions.

The @ref ColorShapeLinks.TextBased.Lib "Lib" class library acts as an
UI-independent "game engine", offering
@ref ColorShapeLinks.TextBased.Lib.MatchController "match" and
@ref ColorShapeLinks.TextBased.Lib.SessionController "session controllers", as
well as interfaces for the associated event system, allowing to plug-in
renderers (_views_, in [MVC] parlance) or other event handling code at runtime.
It serves as a middleware between
the @ref ColorShapeLinks.Common "Common" library and frontend applications,
such as the one implemented in the @ref ColorShapeLinks.TextBased.App "App"
project. It is not used by the @ref unity-guide "Unity implementation", since
Unity already provides its own game engine logic, forcing
@ref ColorShapeLinks.UnityApp.MatchController "match" and
@ref ColorShapeLinks.UnityApp.SessionController "session" controllers to
be tightly integrated with its way of doing things. Nonetheless, the
@ref ColorShapeLinks.TextBased.Lib "Lib" class library makes the
creation of new ColorShapeLinks TUIs or GUIs very simple, as long as they're
not based on highly prescriptive frameworks such as Unity.

The @ref console-guide "ConsoleApp" projects are organized as follows:

* [ConsoleApp] - Console application solution folder.
  * [ConsoleApp.sln] - Solution file.
  * [ColorShapeLinks] - Folder containing all projects required by the
    console app.
    * [**Common**][Common] - Reference to the Common project branch.
    * [TextBased] - Console app folder.
      * [**App**][App] - The console app (.NET Core 3.1 console app).
      * [**Lib**][Lib] - UI-independent library code for running matches and
        sessions (.NET Standard 2.0 class library).

As in the case of the @ref ColorShapeLinks.Common "Common" project, namespaces
follow folder organization. For example, code in the
[Lib] folder is under the ColorShapeLinks.TextBased.Lib namespace.

## The UnityApp project

The @ref unity-guide "UnityApp" is a ColorShapeLinks frontend implemented in
the [Unity] game engine. Like the @ref console-guide "ConsoleApp", it is
designed around the [MVC] pattern, making use of the models provided by the
@ref ColorShapeLinks.Common "Common" library. In this case, however, the views
and controllers are tightly integrated with the Unity engine. The
@ref unity-guide "UnityApp" project is organized as follows:

* [**UnityApp**][UnityApp] - Unity application solution and project folder.
  * _Other Unity folders not relevant for this discussion_.
  * [Assets] - Project assets, such as code and textures.
    * _Other asset folders not relevant for this discussion_.
    * [Scripts] - Code assets.
      * [**Common**][Common] -  Reference to the Common project branch.
      * [UnityApp][UnityAppCode] - Unity app source code.
